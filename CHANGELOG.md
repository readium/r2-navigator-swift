# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

**Warning:** Features marked as *alpha* may change or be removed in a future release without notice. Use with
*caution.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* (*alpha*) A new navigator for audiobooks.
  * The navigator is chromeless, so you will need to provide your own user interface.
* The EPUB navigator is now able to navigate to a `Locator` using its `text` context. This is useful for search results or highlights missing precise locations.
* New `EPUBNavigatorViewController.evaluateJavaScript()` API to run a JavaScript on the currently visible HTML resource.
* Support for Swift Package Manager (contributed by [@stevenzeck](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-swift/pull/176)).

### Deprecated

* Removed `navigator(_:userContentController:didReceive:)` which is actually not needed since you can provide your own `WKScriptMessageHandler` to `WKUserContentController`.

### Fixed

* Fixed receiving `EPUBNavigatorDelegate.navigator(_:setupUserScripts:)` for the first web view.


## [2.0.0]

### Deprecated

* All APIs deprecated in previous versions are now unavailable.


## [2.0.0-beta.2]

### Added

* New `EPUBNavigatorDelegate` APIs to inject custom JavaScript.
  * Override `navigator(_:setupUserScripts:)` to register additional user script to the `WKUserContentController` of each web view.
  * Override `navigator(_:userContentController:didReceive:)` to receive callbacks from your scripts.

### Fixed

* Optimized performances of preloaded EPUB resources.


## [2.0.0-beta.1]

### Fixed

* EPUBs declaring multiple languages were laid out from right to left if the first language had an RTL reading
progression. Now if no reading progression is set, the `effectiveReadingProgression` will be LTR.


## [2.0.0-alpha.2]

### Added

* Support for the new `Publication` model using the [Content Protection](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/006-content-protection) for DRM rights and the [Fetcher](https://readium.org/architecture/proposals/002-composite-fetcher-api) for resource access.
  * This replaces the `Container` and `DRMLicense` objects which were needed by the navigator before.

### Fixed

* Layout of right-toâ€“left EPUB.
* [Various EPUB navigation issues](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-swift/pull/142):
  * Prevent breaking initial location when calling `updateUserSettings` too soon.
  * Fix weird scrolling behavior when double tapping on the edges to turn pages.
  * Don't send intermediate incorrect locators when loading a pending locator.
* Optimize positions calculation for LCP protected PDF.


## [2.0.0-alpha.1]

### Added

* Support for pop-up footnotes (contributed by [@tooolbox](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-swift/pull/118)).
  * **This is an opt-in feature**. Reading apps can customize how footnotes are presented to the user by implementing `NavigatorDelegate.navigator(_:shouldNavigateToNoteAt:content:referrer:)`. [An example presenting footnotes in pop-ups is demonstrated in the Test App](https://github.com/readium/r2-testapp-swift/pull/328).
  * Footnotes' content is extracted with [scinfu/SwiftSoup](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup), which you may need to add to your app if you're not using Carthage or CocoaPods.
* In EPUB's user settings:
  * Support for hyphenation (contributed by [@ehapmgs](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-swift/pull/76)).
  * Publishers' default styles are now used by default.
  * Default line height is increased to improve readability.
* JavaScript errors are logged in Xcode's console for easier debugging.

### Changed

* [Upgraded to Readium CSS 1.0.0-beta.1.](https://github.com/readium/r2-navigator-swift/pull/125)
  * Two new fonts are available: AccessibleDfa and IA Writer Duospace.
  * The file structure now follows strictly the one from [ReadiumCSS's `dist/`](https://github.com/readium/readium-css/tree/master/css/dist), for easy upgrades and custom builds replacement.

### Fixed

* Jumping to a bookmark (`Locator`) located in a resource that is not already pre-loaded used to fail for some publications.
* Touching interactive elements in fixed-layout EPUBs, when two-page spreads are enabled.
